USF CARRT robot Baxter plays Connect 4

Python source code for connect4 interactive game. Original source code from RethinkRobotics. My contribution was to fork the original code and add human / computer interaction to the game. Baxter now has faces which change expression depending on game status, speaks during game play (including a little trash talk), and has head / arm motion as needed. 

Baxter plays connect 4 at four different levels of difficulty.  This is related to the miniMax tree search depth.  Please see my improved AI code for Connect 4 on the pyconnect_4 repo. That solution implements alpha-beta pruning and can go several layers deeper.  There is a slide presentation in that repo that explains it. 

I also gave robot interaction demonstrations to many groups ranging from the Girl Scouts of America, USF recruiters, STEM, to Florida Senators and USF school president. See Tampa Bay Times article below.
